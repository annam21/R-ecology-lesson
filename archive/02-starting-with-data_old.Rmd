### Presentation of the survey data
```

We are investigating the animal species diversity and weights found within plots at our study
site. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxon            | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file
that contains the survey data from Figshare, and we will use `read.csv()` to
load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`. 
Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL 
("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169"). This source URL downloads a CSV file from 
figshare. The text after the comma ("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv") is the destination of the 
file on your local machine. You'll need to have a folder on your machine called "data_raw" where 
you'll download the file. So this command downloads a file from Figshare, names it 
"portal_data_joined.csv" and adds it to a preexisting folder named "data_raw".

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You are now ready to load the data:

```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been
loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: `surveys`.

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded
properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the
function `head()`:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(surveys)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## Try also
View(surveys)
```

## What are data frames?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are
vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
logical). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```

## Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.


> ### Challenge

> Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Challenge
## Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?
## * What is the class of the object `surveys`?
## * How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
## * How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

```



## Indexing and subsetting data frames

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Indexing and subsetting data frames
```


Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]   
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]   
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]      
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7] 
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]    
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] 
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

## Factors

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with labels and they can be ordered or unordered. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.

### Using `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`

By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain
characters (i.e. text) are coerced (= converted) into factors. In most cases, it is preferable to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when importing
data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data
type.
Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these
columns as `character`. To do so, `read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an
argument called `stringsAsFactors` which can be set to `FALSE`.

Or you can use the function `read_csv()` instead, which we will use going forward.

The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an
annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data
you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame. If not, use it
to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data
entry (for instance, a letter in a column that should only contain numbers).

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is
converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and
usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in this lesson, the best
practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your
date is stored as a separate variable. Using `str()`, We can confirm that our
data frame has a separate column for day, month, and year, and that each contains
integer values.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```
We are going to use the `ymd()` function from the package **`lubridate`** (which belongs to the **`tidyverse`**; learn more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). **`lubridate`** gets installed as part as the **`tidyverse`** installation. When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library("tidyverse")`), the core packages (the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded. **`lubridate`** however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it explicitly with `library(lubridate)`

Start by loading the required package:

```{r load-package, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library("lubridate")
```

`ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts it to a
`Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as being a date and can
be manipulated as such. The argument that the function requires is flexible,
but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".


Let's create a date object and inspect the structure:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
my_date <- ymd("2015-01-01")
str(my_date)
```

Now let's paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
my_date <- ymd(paste("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-")) 
str(my_date)
```

Now we apply this function to the surveys dataset. Create a character vector from the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns of
`surveys` using `paste()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-")
```

This character vector can be used as the argument for `ymd()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))
```

The resulting `Date` vector can be added to `surveys` as a new column called `date`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys$date <- ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))
str(surveys) # notice the new column, with 'date' as the class
```

Let's make sure everything worked correctly. One way to inspect the new column is to use `summary()`:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
summary(surveys$date)
```

Something went wrong: some dates have missing values. Let's investigate where they are coming from.

We can use the functions we saw previously to deal with missing data to identify
the rows in our data frame that are failing. If we combine them with what we learned about subsetting data frames earlier, we can extract the columns "year, "month", "day" from the records that have `NA` in our new column `date`. We will also use `head()` so we don't clutter the output:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
missing_dates <- surveys[is.na(surveys$date), c("year", "month", "day")]

head(missing_dates)
```

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your
analyses, how would you deal with this situation?
